## How to use PYield
### Getting DI Futures Data
```python
import pyield as yd

# Get a pandas dataframe with the DI processed data from B3 (default)
>>> yd.get_di(trade_date='2024-03-08')
 TradeDate ExpirationCode ExpirationDate  BDToExpiration  ...  LastRate  LastAskRate  LastBidRate  SettlementRate
2024-03-08            J24     2024-04-01              15  ...    10.952       10.952       10.956          10.956

```
### Business Days Tools (Brazilian holidays are automatically considered)
```python
# Generate a pandas series with the business days between two dates
>>> yd.generate_bdays(start='2023-12-29', end='2024-01-03')
0   2023-12-29
1   2024-01-02
2   2024-01-03
dtype: datetime64[ns]

# Get the next business day after a given date (offset=1)
>>> yd.offset_bdays(dates="2023-12-29", offset=1)
Timestamp('2024-01-02 00:00:00')

# Get the next business day if it is not a business day (offset=0)
>>> yd.offset_bdays(dates="2023-12-30", offset=0)
Timestamp('2024-01-02 00:00:00')

# Since 2023-12-29 is a business day, it returns the same date (offset=0)
>>> yd.offset_bdays(dates="2023-12-29", offset=0)
Timestamp('2023-12-29 00:00:00')

# Count the number of business days between two dates
# Start date is included, end date is excluded
>>> yd.count_bdays(start='2023-12-29', end='2024-01-02')
1
