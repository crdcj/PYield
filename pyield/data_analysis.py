    Calculates spreads between assets based on the specified spread type.
    If no reference date is provided, the function uses the previous business day.

    Parameters:
        spread_type (str): The type of spread to calculate. Available options are:
            - "DI_vs_PRE": the spread between DI Futures and Treasury Pre-Fixed bonds.

            spread calculation. If None or not provided, defaults to the previous
            business day according to the Brazilian calendar.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the calculated spread in basis points.
        The data is sorted by asset type and maturity/expiration date.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an invalid spread type is provided.
