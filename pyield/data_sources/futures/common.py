    """
    Converts an expiration code into its corresponding expiration date.

    This function translates an expiration code into a specific expiration date based on
    a given mapping. The expiration code consists of a letter representing the month and
    two digits for the year. The function ensures the date returned is a valid business
    day by adjusting weekends and holidays as necessary.

    Args:
        expiration_code (str): The expiration code to be converted, where the first
            letter represents the month and the last two digits represent the year
            (e.g., "F23" for January 2023).

    Returns:
        pd.Timestamp: The expiration date corresponding to the code, adjusted to a valid
            business day. Returns pd.NaT if the code is invalid.

    Examples:
        >>> get_expiration_date("F23")
        pd.Timestamp('2023-01-01')

        >>> get_expiration_date("Z33")
        pd.Timestamp('2033-12-01')

        >>> get_expiration_date("A99")
        pd.NaT

    Notes:
        The expiration date is calculated based on the format change introduced by B3 on
        22-05-2006, where the first letter represents the month and the last two digits
        represent the year.
