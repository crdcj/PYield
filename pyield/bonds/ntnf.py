    Calculate the Macaulay duration for an NTN-F bond.

    The Macaulay duration is a weighted average of the times until each payment is
    received, with the weights proportional to the present value of the cash flows.

        settlement (DateScalar): The settlement date to calculate the duration.

        rate (float): The yield to maturity (YTM) used to discount the cash flows.
